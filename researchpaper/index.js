// What is the main difference between structured programming languages and object-oriented programming?
// Your Answer
// Object-oriented programming provides a simpler program structure compared to structured programming.
// Correct Answer
// Structured programming languages focus on functions, while object-oriented programming focuses on objects.
// Justification
// Structured programming languages primarily focus on functions, while object-oriented programming revolves around objects and their interactions.
// 16
// How does inheritance benefit object-oriented programming?
// Your Answer
// It reduces code redundancy.
// Correct Answer
// It reduces code redundancy.
// Justification
// Inheritance allows us to eliminate redundant code by extending the use of existing classes, which helps in reducing code redundancy.
// 17
// Is C++ a superset of the C language?
// Your Answer
// No, C++ and C are completely independent languages.
// Correct Answer
// Yes, any valid C program is also a valid C++ program.
// Justification
// C++ is a superset of the C language, meaning that any valid C program can also be compiled and executed as a C++ program.
// 18
// What is the purpose of data hiding in OOP?
// Your Answer
// To ensure secure programs
// Correct Answer
// To ensure secure programs
// Justification
// Data hiding in OOP helps the programmer build secure programs by making the data of one class secure from other parts of the program.
// 19
// What is object-oriented programming (OOP)?
// Your Answer
// A programming strategy for writing software where data and behavior are packaged together as classes and objects.
// Correct Answer
// A programming strategy for writing software where data and behavior are packaged together as classes and objects.
// Justification
// Object-oriented programming is a programming strategy where data and behavior are combined into classes and objects, allowing for modular and reusable code.
